You choose storytime and crafts! Everyone gathers around to listen to fun stories and create beautiful crafts together. The laughter and creativity fill the air, making the party special. You can see your friends enjoying every moment!

When the guests arrive, they find a cozy place to sit, and soon they are lost in stories and crafting. They thank you for the fun idea as they enjoy the food and the yummy chocolate cake. At the end of the day, everyone leaves with charming goody bags packed with surprises!

You feel proud of the magical day you created together.
