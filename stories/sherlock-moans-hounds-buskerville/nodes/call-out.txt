You decide to call out, hoping to learn more about the shadows. "Hello? Is anyone there?" you shout. The growling stops, and the shadows shift. Suddenly, the hounds step into the light, their eyes sparkling like jewels.

You stand in awe as they approach you. They are magnificent, their fur shining in the moonlight. You feel a sense of calm wash over you. One of the hounds sits down in front of you, as if inviting you to come closer.

What will you do now? Will you try to touch the hound or ask it a question?
