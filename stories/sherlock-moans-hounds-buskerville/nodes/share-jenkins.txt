You decide to share your discovery with Mr. Jenkins. You tell him about the diary and the mention of hidden passages. He seems excited and encourages you to search for those passages right away!

Together, you comb through the study, looking for any signs of hidden doors or tunnels. As you search, you come across a large bookshelf that seems different from the others.

Do you want to push on the bookshelf to see if it opens, or continue searching the study for clues?
