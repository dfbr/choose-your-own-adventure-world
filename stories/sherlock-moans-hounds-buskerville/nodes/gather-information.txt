You decide it’s better to gather more information from the townsfolk. You and Mr. Jenkins walk around the village, asking people about the hounds and the legends of Buskerville Manor.

Many share wild stories, but one elderly lady mentions a hidden treasure. "They say the hounds guard it!" she whispers. Her eyes twinkle with mischief.

Excited by this new information, you feel drawn back to the manor. But there’s still so much to uncover! Do you want to head back to the manor now, or discuss this with Mr. Jenkins to form a plan?
