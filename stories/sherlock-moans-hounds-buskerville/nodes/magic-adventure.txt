You take the wand and feel a spark of excitement. With the wand in hand, you feel like a true adventurer! The little girl smiles at you and says, "Let’s unlock the hidden treasures together!"

Inside, you see a room filled with treasures from stories long past. The air is thick with mystery and excitement. What will you do with all these treasures?
