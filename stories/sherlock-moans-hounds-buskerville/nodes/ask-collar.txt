You decide to ask the vendor about the collar. You ask, "What does this collar mean?" The vendor smiles and says, "Ah, that collar belongs to a hound that protects the treasure of Buskerville. It is said that only those with bravery can find it!"

Your excitement grows. You look at the boy and the dog, feeling inspired. "Let’s find the treasure together!" you say.

You gather your courage and run after the boy and the dog. The adventure is on! You know you need to head toward the old park where the treasure is rumored to be hidden. Should you all go straight to the park or stop at the fountain first to gather more information?
