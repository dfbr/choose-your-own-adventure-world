You decide to explore the stage. As you step onto the wooden boards, you feel a wave of inspiration wash over you. The music from the past seems to echo in your ears.

You see old instruments and props scattered around. Suddenly, you spot a glittering object peeking from behind a curtain. It could be a clue! As you approach, you hear a soft laugh.

"You found it!" a little girl appears from behind the curtain, smiling brightly. "It’s a magic key! It opens a chest hidden in the park!" Your excitement grows. Should you ask her for more information or take the key and head to the park?
