You decide to ask Mr. Jenkins more about the sheep. "What do you think the hounds want with them?" you inquire. He shrugs, looking puzzled. "I really don’t know. Maybe they are looking for food?"

You think carefully about the missing sheep and the tales of the hounds. Perhaps gathering more information about the history might help you.

You suggest heading to Buskerville Manor together. Mr. Jenkins agrees, and off you go! The sun begins to set, casting a golden light over the fields.

As you approach the manor, you notice something glimmering near the entrance. Could it be another clue?
