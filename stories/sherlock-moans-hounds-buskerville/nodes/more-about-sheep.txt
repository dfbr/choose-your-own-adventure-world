You decide to ask Mr. Jenkins more about his missing cat. "What do you think happened to her?" you inquire. He shrugs, looking puzzled. "I really don’t know. Maybe those foxes or the hounds are looking for food?"

You think carefully about the missing cat and the tales of the hounds and foxes. Perhaps gathering more information about the building's history might help you.

You suggest heading to Buskerville Townhouse together. Mr. Jenkins agrees, and off you go! The city lights begin to glow as evening falls over the streets.

As you approach the townhouse, you notice something glimmering near the entrance. Could it be another clue?
