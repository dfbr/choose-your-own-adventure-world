You turn to Mr. Jenkins and ask about the sheep. He explains, "They started disappearing last week. At night, I can hear strange howling! I’m sure the hounds are responsible!"

You think for a moment and ask, "Have you seen the hounds?" Mr. Jenkins shakes his head. "No, but I found paw prints near my sheep pen. They were huge!"

Feeling inquisitive, you ask Mr. Jenkins to show you the sheep pen. He agrees, and soon you follow him through the fields. The sun shines brightly, and the flowers bloom around you.

At the sheep pen, you notice something interesting. There are indeed large paw prints in the mud! But next to them, you spot something shiny.

Do you want to examine the shiny object, or look for more clues around the pen?
