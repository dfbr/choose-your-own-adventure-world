You decide to follow the howling sound. As you walk, it grows louder, echoing through the trees. You feel both excited and a little scared.

After a few minutes, you arrive at a clearing. In the center, you see a pack of dogs gathered together, howling at the moon. They look majestic and powerful.

Do you want to approach the dogs, or observe from a distance?
