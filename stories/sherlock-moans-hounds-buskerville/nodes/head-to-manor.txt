With the locket in hand, you decide to head back to the townhouse with Mr. Jenkins. As you walk, you discuss the locket and its possible connection to the townhouse's history. The city park trees sway gently, whispering secrets of the past.

When you arrive, the townhouse stands tall and imposing. You push open the heavy door and step inside. Everything feels even more mysterious than before.

You find a dusty old study filled with books and papers. One book catches your eye; it looks like a diary. You blow the dust off the cover and open it. Inside, you find stories of the townhouse and a mention of hidden treasure!

Feeling excited, do you want to read more of the diary, or look around the study for more clues?
