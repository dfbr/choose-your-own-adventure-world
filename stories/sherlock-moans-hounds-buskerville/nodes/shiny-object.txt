You reach down to examine the shiny object. To your surprise, it is an old silver locket! You open it carefully and find a picture of a young girl inside, smiling brightly.

Mr. Jenkins leans in to look. "I’ve never seen this before! Could it belong to someone from the townhouse?" he wonders. You both agree that this locket could be an important clue in solving the mystery of the hounds and the missing cat.

With the locket in your hand, you feel a surge of excitement. Do you want to head back to the townhouse with Mr. Jenkins, or ask him more about the alley?
