You decide to observe from a distance. The dogs continue howling, their voices harmonizing in a beautiful melody. You feel entranced by their song.

Suddenly, the howling stops, and the largest dog approaches you cautiously. You hold your breath, curious about what will happen next.

Do you want to approach the dog, or stay where you are?
