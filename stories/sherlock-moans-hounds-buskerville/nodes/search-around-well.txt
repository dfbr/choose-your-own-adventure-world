You decide to search around the old well. You notice strange markings on the stones. They look like symbols! You sketch them quickly in your notebook.

As you study the symbols, you feel a strange energy in the air. Suddenly, the ground shakes, and a hidden door swings open in the ground next to the well!

Do you want to explore the hidden door, or return to find Mr. Jenkins?
