You ask the hounds, "How can I be brave like you?" The hounds look at you with their glowing eyes, as if understanding your question. One of them steps forward, nuzzling your hand gently.

You feel a warmth in your heart. You realize bravery comes from within. You take a deep breath and say, "I want to help protect the treasures of Buskerville!"

Suddenly, the hounds bark in agreement and lead you to a nearby tree. They pause at the base, sniffing the ground. Could there be something hidden here? Do you want to dig around the roots or look up in the tree first?
