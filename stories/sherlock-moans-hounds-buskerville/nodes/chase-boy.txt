You decide to chase after the boy and the dog. You run through the market, your heart racing with excitement. The boy giggles as he plays with the dog, darting around the stalls.

Finally, you catch up to them. The dog barks happily, wagging its tail. You notice the collar on the dog has a strange symbol. The boy notices you and asks, "Are you a detective? Can you help us find the lost treasure?" Your heart flutters. This sounds like a new adventure!

Will you help the boy and the dog find the treasure, or do you want to ask them about the collar first?
