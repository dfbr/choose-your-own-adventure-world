You decide to look around the hall first. The walls are adorned with pictures of past performances, and the air is filled with the scent of old wood. You feel the history around you. As you walk, something catches your eye—a small door slightly ajar. 

Curiosity gets the better of you, and you peek inside. It’s a small room filled with costumes! You see a beautiful cloak that seems to shimmer in the dim light. You can’t resist. You want to try it on or search for more clues in the room.
