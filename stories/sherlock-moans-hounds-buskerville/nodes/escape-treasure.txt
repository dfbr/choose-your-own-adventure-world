You decide to leave the treasure and escape back to safety. As you turn to run, the barking grows louder! You race back through the tunnel, your heart pounding.

Finally, you burst into the sunlight, gasping for breath. Mr. Jenkins looks worried but relieved to see you. You both decide to tell your neighbors about the treasure, but you know it is best left undisturbed.

Back in the neighborhood, you share your adventure. Everyone listens in awe as you tell them about the dogs and the treasure. You learn that sometimes, the real treasure is the friends you make and the stories you share. You are a hero in their eyes, and that feels even better than gold!

You realize that every adventure teaches you something special. You smile, knowing you will always cherish this mystery.
