You decide to gather more clues at the market. You approach different vendors, eager to hear their tales. An old man selling spices says, "Those hounds are no ordinary dogs! They protect something very special."

You lean in closer, intrigued. He continues, "There’s a hidden treasure in Buskerville, and the hounds guard it fiercely. If you want to find out more, you must visit the library. The librarian knows all the secrets of the neighborhood!"

With this new information, you thank the old man and feel a sense of purpose. You know you must visit the library before night falls. Should you rush to the library, or do you still want to explore the market a bit more?
