You decide to ask the librarian for more help. She smiles warmly and says, "I can tell you about the treasure, but first, you must answer another question. What is the color of the sky on a clear day?"

You think for a moment and then say, "Blue!" The librarian claps her hands in delight. "Well done! Now, the treasure is hidden in a place where laughter fills the air, right in the heart of Buskerville!" She hands you a small key with a note saying, "Find the laughter."

Armed with this new information, you feel ready to uncover the treasure. Should you head to the park where children play or to a nearby theater where performances are happening?
