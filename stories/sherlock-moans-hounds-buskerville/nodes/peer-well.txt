You lean over the edge of the old stone well, peering into the darkness below. It feels cool and damp. As your eyes adjust, you notice something shimmering at the bottom!

Suddenly, you hear the howling again, echoing from deep within the well! It sends a chill down your spine, but you also feel a thrill of adventure.

Do you want to try to retrieve the shining object, or call for Mr. Jenkins to help?
