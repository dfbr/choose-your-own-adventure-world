You tiptoe closer to the arguing duo. The tall man says, "The hounds are real! I saw them last night near the park!" The woman responds, "You are just telling stories! There is no such thing as ghostly hounds in London!" You decide to jump in and ask them about what they know.

They stop arguing and look at you. You introduce yourself as Sherlock Moans. The man introduces himself as Mr. Jenkins and the woman as Miss Green. They agree to share their stories with you.

Mr. Jenkins, with a worried look, explains how his pet cat has gone missing. "They say the hounds or maybe those wild foxes are to blame!" he exclaims. Miss Green, however, believes he is just imagining things. You realize you need more information to solve this city mystery.

Do you want to ask Mr. Jenkins about his missing cat, or ask Miss Green about her doubts?
