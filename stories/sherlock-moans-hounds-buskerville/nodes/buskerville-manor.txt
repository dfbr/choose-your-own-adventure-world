With determination, you head straight to Buskerville Manor. The grand old house stands tall, surrounded by misty hills. You can feel the eerie atmosphere, but you are not scared. You feel brave!

As you approach the manor, you notice footprints in the mud. They are large and seem to lead towards the woods. You take a deep breath and decide to follow the footprints.

Suddenly, you hear a howl in the distance! Your heart races, but you are excited. You think, 'This is it! The mystery unfolds!'

Do you want to follow the footprints deeper into the woods, or explore the manor first?
