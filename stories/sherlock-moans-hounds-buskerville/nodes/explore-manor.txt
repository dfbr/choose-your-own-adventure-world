You decide to explore the manor first. As you enter, the air feels heavy with mystery. Dust dances in the sunlight that streams through the tall windows. You can hear the creaking of the old wood beneath your feet.

In the corner of the main hall, you spot a large painting of a man who looks like he could be the owner of the manor. His eyes seem to follow you!

You walk closer and notice something shiny on the floor beneath the painting. It looks like an old key! 

Do you want to take the key, or keep searching the manor for more clues?
