You dig excitedly at the spot the hounds led you to. The earth is soft, and your hands uncover something shiny. You pull out a small, ornate chest!

Your heart races as you open it. Inside are beautiful treasures—colorful gems, old coins, and a note. The note reads, "These treasures are for the brave who protect the stories of Buskerville. Share them with the community!" You feel a wave of joy.

The hounds bark happily and seem to understand your excitement. You can choose to take the treasures to the local community center or share them at a neighborhood festival. What will you do?
