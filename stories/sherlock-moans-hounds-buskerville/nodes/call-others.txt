You decide to call the other dogs over. They come trotting back, and the special dog seems to lead the pack. The dogs gather around you, wagging their tails and barking happily.

With all the dogs around, you feel a sense of comfort. You decide to follow the special dog, who seems to know where to go. It leads you deeper into the woods.

Soon, you arrive at a hidden glade. In the middle stands an ancient tree with a hollow at its base. You feel something magical about this place.

Do you want to explore the hollow tree, or look around the glade first?
