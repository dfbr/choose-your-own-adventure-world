You choose to approach quietly, careful not to startle whatever is lurking in the shadows. As you draw closer, the moonlight reveals a group of large dogs with soft, glowing eyes. They are the hounds!

The hounds sit down, their ears perked up, as if waiting for you to continue. You realize you should ask them a question. What will you ask the hounds?
