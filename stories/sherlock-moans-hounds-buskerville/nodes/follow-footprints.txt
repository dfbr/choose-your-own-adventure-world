You decide to follow the footprints deeper into the woods. The trees are tall and thick, and the air is cool. You hear the leaves crunching under your feet as you walk. Suddenly, you hear a rustling sound!

You stop and listen carefully. The sound grows louder and closer, and then you see them! A group of dogs is playing together in a clearing! They don’t look like hounds at all. They are friendly, wagging their tails.

You giggle and realize they must be the source of the stories. But why did people think they were ghostly hounds? You decide to take a closer look.

Do you want to approach the dogs, or observe them from a distance?
