You decide to follow the footprints into the city park. The trees are tall and the air is cool, but the distant sounds of traffic remind you you’re still in London. You hear the crunch of gravel under your shoes as you walk along the path. Suddenly, you hear a rustling sound!

You stop and listen carefully. The sound grows louder and closer, and then you see them! A group of dogs is playing together in a grassy clearing near the playground. They don’t look like hounds at all. They are friendly, wagging their tails.

You giggle and realize they must be the source of the stories. But why did people think they were ghostly hounds? You decide to take a closer look.

Do you want to approach the dogs, or observe them from a distance?
