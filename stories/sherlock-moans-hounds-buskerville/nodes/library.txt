You rush to the library, excitement bubbling inside you. The library is a grand old building, filled with the scent of books and whispers of history. You find the librarian, a kind woman with glasses perched on her nose.

You tell her about the ghostly hounds and the hidden treasure. She smiles knowingly and says, "Ah, the hounds are guardians of the Buskerville treasure. Only the brave can seek it. But you must solve a riddle to find the treasure’s location!"

She hands you a piece of paper with the riddle written on it. You read it aloud: "I have keys but open no locks. I have space but no room. What am I?" You think hard about the answer. After a moment, you smile. Do you want to solve the riddle now or ask the librarian for more help?
