You decide to observe the dogs from a distance. They continue to play, and you notice one dog that is different from the others. It stands apart, watching the park closely. Something about it feels special.

As you watch, the wind picks up and rustles the leaves. Suddenly, the different dog starts to bark! You feel a shiver go down your spine. This sounds just like the stories! You wonder if this dog knows something important.

Do you want to approach that dog, or call the others over to join you?
