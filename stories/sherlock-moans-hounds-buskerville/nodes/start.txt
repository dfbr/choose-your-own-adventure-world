You are in London, the bustling city filled with life and stories. The streets hum with the sounds of people chatting, buses rumbling, and the distant chime of Big Ben. You are Sherlock Moans, a brilliant young detective known for your moans and sighs, always searching for the next mystery to solve.

Today, you hear whispers of strange happenings in the neighborhood of Buskerville. They say there are ghostly hounds seen at night, roaming the foggy streets. You feel a tingle of excitement at the thought of a new case. 

As you grab your deer-stalker hat, you take a deep breath. The air is crisp, and the scent of fresh bread from a nearby bakery fills you with energy. "Time to find out what’s going on in Buskerville!" you say to yourself, ready for adventure.

You step outside, your eyes sparkling with curiosity. Will you visit the local market first or head straight to the park where the hounds were last seen?
