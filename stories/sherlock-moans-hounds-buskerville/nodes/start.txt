The air is crisp in London as you walk down Baker Street. You are Sherlock Moans, a clever girl known for your moaning and sighing. Today, you have a new mystery to solve! People are saying that a pack of ghostly hounds is terrorizing the city streets near the old Buskerville Townhouse, and some even claim to have seen wild foxes behaving strangely in the parks at night.

You pull your tweed coat tighter and adjust your deer-stalker hat. Your hazel eyes scan the busy street, taking in the double-decker buses, the distant chime of Big Ben, and the lively chatter of people from many cultures. London is a vibrant city! But today, your focus is on the urban mystery that awaits.

As you ponder the case, you hear two voices arguing near a newsstand. One is a tall man with a thick accent, and the other is a woman with bright red hair. They seem to be discussing the legend of the hounds and the recent sightings of foxes in the city.

You feel a tug of curiosity. Should you investigate their discussion, or head straight to Buskerville Townhouse to search for clues in the heart of London?
