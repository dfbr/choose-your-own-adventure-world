You choose to explore the theater on your own. As you wander through the hallways, you see posters of past performances. The walls are filled with stories of creativity.

Suddenly, you hear music coming from a rehearsal room! You peek inside and see actors preparing for their show. They notice you and wave. "Would you like to join us?" they ask, inviting you in.

You feel a thrill of excitement. Will you join them in the rehearsal or continue exploring the theater?
