You decide to visit the local market. The market is alive with colors and sounds. Stalls filled with fresh fruits, spices, and unique crafts line the streets. You hear the chatter of people from all over the world, each sharing their stories and cultures.

As you wander through the market, you spot a friendly vendor selling bright fruits. "Hello, young detective! Have you seen those ghostly hounds?" she asks, a twinkle in her eye. You shake your head, eager to learn more.

She leans closer and whispers, "I heard they appear near the old fountain at midnight. You might want to check it out!" You thank her for the tip and feel your heart race with excitement. You wonder if you should gather more clues at the market or head directly to the fountain tonight.

What will you do next?
