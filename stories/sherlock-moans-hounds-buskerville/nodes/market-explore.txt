You decide to explore the market a bit more. You wander through the vibrant stalls, enjoying the sights and sounds of the busy market. You stop at a stall selling colorful scarves from all around the world. The vendor, a cheerful woman, tells you about the stories behind each scarf.

You feel inspired as you listen. Suddenly, a little boy runs by, giggling, with a dog chasing after him. You notice the dog has a strange collar that looks like it belongs to a hound! Weren’t you just hearing about ghostly hounds?

You follow the boy and dog, your curiosity piqued. Should you chase after them or ask the vendor about the collar first?
