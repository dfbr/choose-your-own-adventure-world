You decide to explore the hidden door. With a deep breath, you push it open. Inside, you find a dark tunnel leading downwards. The air is cool and smells of earth.

You turn to Mr. Jenkins, who looks nervous but excited. "Are you ready?" you ask. He nods, and together you step into the tunnel. As you walk, the light from above fades away.

Suddenly, you hear the sound of howling again! It echoes off the walls, sending chills down your spine. But you press on, determined to solve the mystery.

Do you want to keep going deeper, or turn back to the light above?
