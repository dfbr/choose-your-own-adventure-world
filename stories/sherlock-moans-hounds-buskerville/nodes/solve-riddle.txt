You take a deep breath and declare, "The answer is a piano!" The librarian beams at you. "Exactly! The treasure is hidden near a place where music fills the air." She hands you a map, showing the location of an old music hall.

You feel a rush of excitement as you thank her and set off to find the music hall. The streets of London guide you with their familiar sounds. When you arrive, you see the legendary hall, its doors slightly ajar.

You enter cautiously, the air filled with melodies from the past. You can hear music coming from the stage. Do you want to explore the stage or look around the hall first?
