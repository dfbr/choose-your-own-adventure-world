You decide to share the treasures at a neighborhood festival. The air is filled with laughter and the smell of delicious food. You set up a small table with the gems and coins, inviting everyone to take a piece of the treasure.

People gather around, amazed at the beautiful items. You share the story of how you found them and the importance of community. The festival becomes a celebration of sharing and friendship.

As the sun sets, the hounds sit proudly beside you, knowing they helped you on this journey. You feel a sense of belonging and happiness, surrounded by friends and laughter. You know you will always treasure this moment.
