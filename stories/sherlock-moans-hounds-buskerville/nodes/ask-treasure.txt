You ask the hounds, "Are you here to protect a treasure?" The hounds seem to nod as they sit patiently. You take a deep breath and say, "If I help you, will you show me where the treasure is?"

To your surprise, one of the hounds barks softly, and they start to move, guiding you through the foggy night. You follow closely, heart pounding with excitement and curiosity.

The hounds lead you to an ancient oak tree in the park. One of them paws at the ground, revealing something shining beneath the leaves. Could this be the treasure? You feel a sense of wonder. Will you dig it up or call for help?
