You take the treasures to the community center, where people are excited to see what you found. You share the gems, coins, and the note with everyone. They all gather around, eyes wide with wonder.

The community leader thanks you and says, "These treasures remind us of our history and the importance of sharing!" You feel proud and happy, knowing you helped bring smiles to so many faces.

As the celebration begins, the hounds sit by your side, wagging their tails. You realize your adventure has brought the community together.

You say to the hounds, "Thank you for guiding me!" They bark joyfully, and you know this is just the beginning of more adventures to come.
