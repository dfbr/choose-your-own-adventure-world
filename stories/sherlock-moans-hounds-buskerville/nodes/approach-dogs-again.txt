You decide to approach the dogs. They stop barking and turn to look at you. Their eyes shine with intelligence, and you feel a connection.

Slowly, you reach out your hand, and one of the dogs steps forward. It nudges your hand, and you smile! This must be one of the legendary city dogs.

Do you want to follow the dog to see where it leads, or wait and see what the other dogs do?
