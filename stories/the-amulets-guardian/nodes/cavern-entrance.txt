You swim into the cavern. It is dark but your mermaid tail glows softly, lighting the way. The walls are covered in carvings. They tell the story of the amulet. It was made by the sea creatures long ago. They hid it to keep it safe. But now, you need to find it. Suddenly, you see two tunnels. One tunnel has warm water flowing through it. The other tunnel is cold and dark. Both seem to lead deeper into the cavern.
