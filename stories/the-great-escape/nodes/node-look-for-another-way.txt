You decide to explore the room a bit more. There might be another way out. You carefully scan the walls, looking for hidden doors or passages.

On the far wall, you notice a tapestry hanging slightly askew. Behind it, you find a narrow, winding staircase. It might lead somewhere safe, or it could be a trap.

Your heart pounds as you consider the possibility. But staying here is not an option, so you decide to take the risk.

The stairs creak under your weight as you tiptoe downwards. The air becomes cooler, and you hear the distant sound of dripping water. Your mind races with the possibility of where this staircase might lead.

Suddenly, you hear footsteps above. The gang might have noticed your absence. You have to decide quickly whether to keep going down or find a hiding spot.
