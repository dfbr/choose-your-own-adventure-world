You keep moving forward, your footsteps echoing in the long corridor. The walls are lined with old portraits, their eyes seeming to follow you as you pass.

At the end of the corridor, you find a heavy wooden door. You try the handle—it creaks open, revealing a spiral staircase leading down into darkness.

Choices:
- Descend the staircase (nextNode: node-descend-staircase)
- Go back and try another route (nextNode: node-back-to-corridor)
