You decide to take the stairs, hoping they lead you closer to freedom. Each step creaks slightly, but you move swiftly to reach the top.

At the top of the stairs, you find a small, dusty room filled with old books and maps. A large window offers a view of the surrounding countryside. You could climb out, but it's quite high.

As you look around, you notice a map of the castle pinned to the wall. This could be incredibly useful! You study it carefully, noting marked exits and passages.

Suddenly, you hear voices approaching. It seems you are running out of time. You can either attempt to climb out of the window or use the map to find another exit.

Both options have risks, but you must decide quickly.
