You study the paper closely. The numbers seem random at first, but then you notice a pattern. It's a simple substitution cipher, where each number represents a letter. You quickly jot down the alphabet and start matching the numbers to letters.

After a few minutes of concentration, you translate the code: "OPEN SESAME". With excitement, you punch the phrase into the keypad by the door.

The lock clicks open! Your heart races with a mixture of fear and thrill as you push the door open slowly, trying not to make a sound.

Beyond the door is a dimly lit corridor. It stretches out with doors on either side. You can hear faint voices echoing from somewhere deeper in the castle. You need to make a decision quickly.

To the left, you see a staircase leading up. It might take you to the roof or another exit. To the right, the corridor continues into shadows. Where should you go?
