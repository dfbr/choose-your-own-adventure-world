You keep going down the winding staircase, the air growing colder with each step. At the bottom, you find yourself in a dimly lit cellar filled with crates and barrels.

- Search the cellar for a secret exit (nextNode: node-search-cellar)
- Hide behind the barrels (nextNode: node-hide-behind-barrels)
