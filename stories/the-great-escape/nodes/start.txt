You find yourself in a dusty, dimly lit room inside an old castle. It's cold and the air is filled with the echo of distant voices. You are not alone here—this castle is the hideout for a gang of criminals planning a big bank robbery. But you have a plan of your own: escape without being caught.

You look around the room and spot a rusty old door. It might be your way out, but it's locked. Beside the door is a note with a series of numbers, a cipher to crack. You know if you can figure it out, you can enter the correct code to unlock the door.

On a small wooden table, there's a piece of paper filled with coded numbers. Your maths skills are sharp, and you remember learning about substitution ciphers in school. This is your first challenge.

You feel the importance of the situation. If you can crack the code, you might just find your way to freedom. But if you fail, it might lead to capture. You take a deep breath and focus.
