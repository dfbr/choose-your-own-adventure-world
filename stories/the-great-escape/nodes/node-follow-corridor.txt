You decide to follow the corridor, moving quietly and quickly. The walls are lined with old paintings and the floor is covered with a thick carpet.

As you walk, you hear voices coming from a room ahead. You stop and listen closely. The gang is discussing their plans for the bank robbery. If you could somehow alert the authorities, you might foil their plan.

You spot a door slightly ajar. Inside, you see a stack of papers that might contain the details of their plan. But getting too close could be risky.

You weigh your options: sneak in and grab the papers to find a way to alert help, or continue down the corridor in hopes of a safer escape.

Each choice carries risk, but also the chance to stop the criminals.
