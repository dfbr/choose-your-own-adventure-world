You are not alone here - this castle is the hideout for a gang of criminals planning a big bank robbery. But you have a plan of your own: escape without being caught.\n\nYou look around the room and spot a rusty old door. It might be your way out, but it's locked. Beside the door is a note with a series of numbers, a cipher to crack. You know if you can figure it out, you can enter the correct code to unlock the door.\n\nOn a small wooden table, there's a piece of paper filled with coded numbers. Your maths skills are sharp, and you remember learning about substitution ciphers in school. This is your first challenge.\n\nYou feel the importance of the situation. If you can crack the code, you might just find your way to freedom. But if you fail, it might lead to capture. You take a deep breath and focus."

You quickly jot down the alphabet and start matching the numbers to letters.\n\nAfter a few minutes of concentration, you translate the code: \"OPEN SESAME\". With excitement, you punch the phrase into the keypad by the door.\n\nThe lock clicks open! Your heart races with a mixture of fear and thrill as you push the door open slowly, trying not to make a sound.\n\nBeyond the door is a dimly lit corridor. It stretches out with doors on either side. You can hear faint voices echoing from somewhere deeper in the castle. You need to make a decision quickly.\n\nTo the left, you see a staircase leading up. It might take you to the roof or another exit. To the right, the corridor continues into shadows. Where should you go?"

But staying here is not an option, so you decide to take the risk.\n\nThe stairs creak under your weight as you tiptoe downwards.
