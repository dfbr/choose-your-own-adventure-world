Oh no! That answer is not correct. The stink bomb goes off with a loud, funny sound! Everyone bursts into laughter, but the park is filled with a terrible stink. Your friends giggle, and you all decide to run away together to avoid the smell. 'Next time, we’ll be better prepared!' you say. But for now, the day is still fun, and you know you can always try again.

With your friends, you play other games, and the stink bomb adventure becomes a funny story you’ll tell for years! What a day it turned out to be!
