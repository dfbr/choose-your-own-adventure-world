Hooray! The Blue Whale is indeed the largest mammal in the ocean! With that final answer, the bomb beeps and goes silent. You and your friends cheer, jumping up and down with joy! Suddenly, out pops a familiar face from behind the bushes. It’s your friend Max, giggling! 'I planted the stink bomb to make it a fun challenge! I’m proud of how you all worked together!'

You all laugh and celebrate your teamwork, grateful for the fun adventure. The park is safe again, and everyone can play without a stink. What a day!
