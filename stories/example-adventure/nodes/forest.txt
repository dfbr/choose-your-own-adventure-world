You enter the forest, and the canopy above filters the fading sunlight into a gentle green glow. The air is cool and filled with the scent of pine and earth.

As you walk deeper, you notice a narrow path leading further into the woods. Strange markings on the trees suggest that others have passed this way before.

Do you dare venture deeper, or return to reconsider your path?
