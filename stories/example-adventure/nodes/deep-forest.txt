You venture deep into the heart of the forest, where the trees grow so thick that barely any light penetrates the canopy. 

Suddenly, you stumble upon a hidden grove where ancient ruins stand covered in moss and vines. In the center, a crystal fountain glows with an ethereal light.

You've discovered one of the forest's greatest secrets! As you approach, the crystal begins to hum with ancient magic, and you realize you've completed your quest.

Congratulations, adventurer!
