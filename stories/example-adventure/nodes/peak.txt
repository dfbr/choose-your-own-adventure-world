After a challenging climb, you finally reach the mountain peak. The view is breathtaking - you can see for miles in every direction.

As the sun sets, painting the sky in brilliant shades of orange and purple, you notice something gleaming among the rocks. It's an ancient artifact, left here long ago by those who came before.

You've conquered the mountain and claimed its treasure! Your adventure has come to a triumphant end.

Well done, brave explorer!
