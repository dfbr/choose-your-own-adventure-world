You are Luna, a small gray cat with bright green eyes. You live in a cozy little house at the edge of a big forest. Every morning, you wake up and stretch in the warm sunshine that comes through your window.

Today feels different. Today feels special. You can feel it in your whiskers.

When you jump down from your bed, you see something amazing. There are tiny sparkles of light floating in the air! They look like little stars, but they are right here in your room. The sparkles are gold and silver, and they shimmer and shine.

You follow the sparkles with your eyes. They dance and twirl through the air. Some float near your toy mouse. Others drift toward the door. The sparkles seem to be showing you something. They seem to want you to follow them.

Your heart beats fast with excitement. This is the start of an adventure! You have never seen magical sparkles before. Where did they come from? What do they want to show you?

You look out your window at the garden. The flowers are blooming bright and colorful. The old oak tree stands tall and strong. Maybe the sparkles came from the garden?

But the sparkles inside are so pretty. They float and dance like they are calling to you. Should you follow them? Or should you go outside to the garden first?

You sit very still and think. Your tail swishes back and forth. You are ready for an adventure, but which way should you go?

What will you do?
