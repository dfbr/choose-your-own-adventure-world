You decide to follow the sparkles! They are so pretty and magical. You want to see where they go.

The sparkles float slowly through your room. They move toward the door, so you follow them. Your paws are quiet on the floor. You feel like you are in a dream, but this is real!

The sparkles lead you outside. The warm sun feels good on your fur. The sparkles float through the air, moving toward the forest. You walk after them, looking up at the shimmering lights.

The forest is full of tall trees and green plants. Birds sing happy songs in the branches. The sparkles lead you down a small path. The path is soft with leaves and moss.

You walk and walk, following the sparkles. They never go too fast. They wait for you to catch up. It is like they want to be your friend.

After a while, you come to a clearing. A clearing is a open space in the forest with no trees. The grass is soft and green here. In the middle of the clearing, you see something amazing.

There is a white rabbit! The rabbit has long ears and a fluffy tail. But this is not a normal rabbit. This rabbit is sitting very still, and it has a gentle glow around it. The sparkles seem to come from the rabbit!

The rabbit looks at you with kind, wise eyes. "Hello, little cat," says the rabbit in a soft voice. "My name is Snowbell. I am glad you followed the sparkles. I need your help."

You sit down and look at Snowbell. Your ears perk up with interest. The rabbit sounds very nice, but also a little bit worried.

"There is a special amulet hidden in this forest," Snowbell explains. "The amulet is very important. It keeps the forest safe and happy. But I cannot find it alone. Will you help me?"

You look around the clearing. You see pretty flowers and butterflies. Everything looks peaceful. But you can tell that Snowbell really needs help.

What will you do?
