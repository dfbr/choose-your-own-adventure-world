You climb up the old oak tree. You are good at climbing! Your claws grip the rough bark. Up, up, up you go. The branches are thick and strong.

When you reach the hole in the tree trunk, you peek inside. At first, it is dark and you cannot see anything. You wait for your eyes to get used to the darkness.

Then you see it. There is something glowing inside the hole! It is a soft, silver light. Your heart beats faster with excitement.

You reach your paw very carefully into the hole. You feel something smooth and cool. Gently, very gently, you pull it out.

It is beautiful! In your paw, you hold a silver amulet shaped like a leaf. The amulet hangs on a delicate silver chain. It glows with a soft, magical light. You can feel the magic tingling in your paw. It feels warm and good.

As soon as you touch the amulet, something amazing happens. The sparkles that led you earlier appear again! They swirl around you in a circle. They make a beautiful pattern in the air.

You hear a voice. It is not a voice with words, but you understand it in your heart. The voice says, "You have found the Amulet of the Forest. You have a pure heart and a brave spirit. Will you be the Guardian?"

You look at the amulet in your paw. Being a Guardian sounds important. It sounds like a big job. But you feel ready. You feel like this is what you were meant to do.

Suddenly, you hear a sound below. You look down and see animals gathering at the base of the tree. There is a rabbit with a gentle glow. There is a deer with big brown eyes. There are squirrels and birds and even a hedgehog! They all look up at you with hope.

"You found it!" calls the rabbit. "You found the amulet! The forest has been waiting for a new Guardian. Will you accept this important job? Or would you like help? We can all be Guardians together!"

The animals look at you with kind faces. They all want to help. The amulet feels warm in your paw. You feel special and important.

What will you do?
