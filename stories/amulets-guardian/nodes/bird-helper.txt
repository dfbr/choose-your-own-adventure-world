You decide to keep looking around on your own. You are curious and brave, and you want to explore!

You leave Snowbell in the clearing and walk back into the forest. The trees are tall around you. The path is covered with soft leaves. You can hear your quiet paw steps.

As you walk, you look at everything carefully. You see mushrooms growing on old logs. You see ants marching in a line. You see a pretty spider web with dewdrops on it. The forest is full of interesting things!

Suddenly, you hear a sound. It is a bird! You look up and see a bright blue bird sitting on a branch. The bird looks right at you.

"Hello!" says the bird in a cheerful voice. "Are you looking for something?"

You are surprised the bird can talk! "Yes," you say. "I am looking for a magic amulet. Do you know where it is?"

The blue bird fluffs its feathers. "I might! I see everything from up in the sky. But I need help first. My nest fell down in the storm last night. My eggs are cold! If you help me, I will help you."

You look around and see some soft moss and twigs. You are good at finding things! You gather the moss gently in your mouth. You find bendy twigs that are just right for building.

The bird shows you a tree with a good, safe branch. Together, you and the bird build a new nest. You put the moss inside to make it soft. You arrange the twigs to make it strong. The bird lays her eggs in the new nest and sits on them to keep them warm.

"Thank you so much!" says the bird. "You are very kind. Now I will help you. I saw something shiny in the old oak tree near your house. I think it might be what you are looking for!"

Your eyes get big. The old oak tree? That is in your garden! The amulet was close to home the whole time!

You say goodbye to the bird and run back home as fast as you can. Your paws fly over the ground. You run through the forest, through your garden, right to the old oak tree.

And there, in a hole in the tree trunk, you see it – a silver amulet shaped like a leaf! It glows with soft magic light. You reach in carefully and take it out.

The moment you touch the amulet, you feel warm and happy. The amulet is yours now. But you know this happened because you were kind to the bird. When you help others, good things come back to you!
