You walk over to the flower bed very carefully. You do not want to step on any of the pretty flowers. Your paws find the spaces between the plants.

You get closer to the shiny thing. Now you can see it better. It looks like a small piece of metal, partly covered by dirt and petals. You use your paw to gently brush away the dirt.

It is something wonderful! You find a tiny metal box. The box is old and has pretty designs carved on it. Flowers and leaves decorate the lid. The box shines like silver in the sun.

You use your claw very carefully to open the box. Inside, there is a piece of paper! The paper is old and yellow, but you can still see what is on it. It is a map!

The map shows your garden and the forest beyond. There is an X marked on the map. The X is right on the big oak tree! You know that tree – it is the one right here in your garden!

Under the map, there are words written in fancy letters. You can read some of them because you are a smart cat. The words say: "The Amulet of the Forest is hidden where the old tree keeps its secrets."

Your heart beats fast with excitement. This is a real treasure map! The amulet is hidden in the old oak tree! You look over at the tree. It stands tall and strong, just like always. But now you know it holds a secret.

You close the box carefully and put it in a safe spot under a bush. You want to keep it safe. Then you walk over to the oak tree.

The tree is even bigger when you stand next to it. The bark is rough and old. You walk around the tree, looking carefully. Then you see it – a small hole in the trunk! The hole is just big enough for you to reach inside.

You stand on your back legs and reach your front paw into the hole. It is dark inside. You feel around carefully. Your paw touches something smooth and cool.

You pull it out slowly. It is beautiful! A silver amulet shaped like a leaf hangs from a delicate chain. The amulet glows with soft, magical light. You can feel the magic tingling in your paw.

You have found the treasure! The map was right! The amulet was in the tree all along, waiting for someone to find it.

Now that you have found the amulet, what will you do with it?
