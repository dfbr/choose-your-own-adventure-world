You walk over to the flower bed, careful not to disturb the blossoms. The air is sweet with the scent of flowers, and the sun warms your fur. As you sniff around, you notice a patch of earth that looks freshly turned.

You gently paw at the soil, uncovering something shiny beneath the surface. It's a tiny metal box, decorated with swirling patterns of leaves and vines. Your heart beats faster with curiosity.

You nudge the box open with your nose. Inside, you find a folded piece of paper and a small, smooth stone that glows faintly. The paper is a map of the garden, with a big X marked at the base of the old oak tree.

You realize this is a clue! The amulet must be hidden where the X is. You tuck the map under your collar and look toward the oak tree, ready for your next adventure.
