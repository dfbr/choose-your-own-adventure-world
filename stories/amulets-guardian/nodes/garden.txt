You decide to check the garden first. Maybe that is where the magic is coming from!

You push open the little cat door and step outside. The sun is warm and bright. The grass feels cool under your paws. You take a deep breath. The air smells like flowers and fresh earth.

Your garden is beautiful today. There are red roses and yellow daisies. There are purple flowers you do not know the names of. Butterflies flutter from flower to flower. They are orange and black and very pretty.

You walk slowly through the garden. You look at everything carefully. Your whiskers twitch as you smell the different scents. Flowers smell sweet. The earth smells rich and deep.

The old oak tree stands in the corner of the garden. It is very, very old. It has thick branches and lots of green leaves. Your favorite spot to nap is under that tree on hot days.

Today, something about the tree looks different. Is there a small hole in the trunk? You walk closer to see better. Yes! There is a hole you never noticed before. It is just big enough for you to peek inside.

Next to the tree is the flower bed. This is where the brightest, most colorful flowers grow. Mom planted them last spring. The flowers make you happy when you look at them.

But wait! You see something shiny in the flower bed. It is partly hidden by the purple flowers. What could it be? Your curiosity makes your tail twitch with excitement.

You hear a sound above you. Two birds are singing in the tree. They seem to be looking at you. Are they trying to tell you something? Birds sometimes know secrets about the garden.

You have three choices now. You could climb the old tree and look in that hole. You could check the shiny thing in the flower bed. Or you could just enjoy the garden and maybe the magic will find you.

The garden feels full of secrets today. Which secret do you want to discover first?

What will you do?
