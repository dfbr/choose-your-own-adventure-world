"Yes, I will help you!" you say to Snowbell the rabbit. You are brave and kind, and you want to help your new friend.

Snowbell's eyes light up with joy. "Thank you, Luna! I knew you would help. You have a good heart. Come, let me tell you about the amulet."

You sit down close to Snowbell. The rabbit's soft glow makes you feel warm and safe.

"Long ago," Snowbell begins, "a wise owl gave the animals of this forest a special gift. It was a silver amulet shaped like a leaf. The amulet has magic inside it. As long as the amulet is safe, the forest stays healthy and happy. The trees grow strong. The flowers bloom bright. All the animals live together in peace."

You listen carefully. This sounds very important!

"But," Snowbell continues, "the amulet was hidden to keep it safe from anyone who might want to use its magic for bad things. Only someone with a pure heart can be the Guardian of the Amulet. The Guardian's job is to keep the amulet safe and protect the forest."

Snowbell looks at you very seriously. "I think you might be the one, Luna. I think you might be the next Guardian. But first, we need to find the amulet. I have been searching for days, but I need help. The forest is very big."

Your heart fills with pride. You could be a Guardian! That sounds like a very important job. But it also sounds like a big responsibility.

"The amulet calls to those with pure hearts," Snowbell says. "If we are quiet and listen with our hearts, we might hear it calling. Or we can search the forest together. There is a beautiful meadow not far from here. That might be a good place to look."

You think about what Snowbell said. You can feel something tingling in your whiskers. Maybe that is the amulet calling? Or maybe you should just search with Snowbell?

You look at your new friend. Snowbell looks back at you with hope in those kind eyes. You want to help so much!

What will you do?
