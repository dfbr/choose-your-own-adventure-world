"Tell me more about the amulet," you say to Snowbell. You want to understand everything before you decide what to do.

Snowbell sits down on a soft patch of moss. You sit next to the rabbit. The forest is quiet and peaceful around you. Only the birds singing and the wind in the leaves make any sound.

"The Amulet of the Forest is very, very old," Snowbell begins. "My grandmother told me the story, and her grandmother told her. The story has been passed down through many generations of rabbits."

You listen carefully. Your ears point forward so you do not miss any words.

"Long ago," Snowbell continues, "the forest was not always safe. There were harsh winters when food was hard to find. There were storms that knocked down trees. Animals were sometimes afraid and alone."

Snowbell's voice becomes softer. "Then one day, a wise old owl made the amulet. The owl used magic from the sun and the moon, from the trees and the flowers, from the earth and the sky. All the best magic in the world went into the amulet."

You imagine the owl making the amulet. It must have been beautiful to watch!

"The amulet," says Snowbell, "keeps the forest in balance. It makes sure there is always enough food. It makes sure the streams stay clean. It helps baby animals grow strong. It keeps all the animals safe and happy. As long as the amulet is protected, the forest will be healthy."

You look around at the beautiful forest. So this is why everything looks so perfect!

"But," Snowbell says seriously, "the amulet needs a Guardian. The Guardian must have a pure heart. The Guardian must be brave but also kind. The Guardian must love the forest and all the animals in it. The Guardian must promise to always protect the amulet and never use its magic for selfish reasons."

Snowbell looks into your eyes. "Luna, I have watched you this morning. You followed the sparkles even though you did not know where they would lead. That was brave. You stopped to listen to me when you could have run away. That was kind. You want to help find the amulet not for yourself, but to help the forest. That shows you have a pure heart."

Your chest feels warm. Snowbell's words make you feel special and important.

"I think you could be the Guardian," Snowbell says. "But it is a big job. You would need to check on the forest every day. You would need to help any animal in trouble. You would need to keep the amulet safe, always."

You think hard. This sounds like a big responsibility. But it also sounds important and meaningful.

"Could I have help?" you ask. "Could you and other animals help me?"

Snowbell's face lights up. "Yes! A Guardian does not have to work alone. We could all help protect the forest together!"

You feel better knowing you would not be alone. You like the idea of having friends to help you.

What will you decide?
