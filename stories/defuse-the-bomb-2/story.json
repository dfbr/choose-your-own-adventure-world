You love adventure, but not the kind that leaves you covered in glitter from head to toe. Your older sibling, ever the prankster, has set this up. They’ve left a note: 'Solve my puzzles or glitter galore!' You roll your eyes, knowing you're up to the challenge.\n\nThe first puzzle is taped to the glitter bomb. It reads:\n\"I’m taken from a mine, and shut up in a wooden case, from which I am never released, and yet I am used by almost every person. What am I?\"\nYou know this is your first step to defusing the bomb. Answer wisely!"
