You stand in front of a glitter bomb. Your heart beats fast. You can almost see the sparkle through the casing. You love adventure, but not the kind that leaves you covered in glitter from head to toe. Your older sibling, ever the prankster, has set this up. They’ve left a note: 'Solve my puzzles or glitter galore!' You roll your eyes, knowing you're up to the challenge.

The first puzzle is taped to the glitter bomb. It reads:
"I’m taken from a mine, and shut up in a wooden case, from which I am never released, and yet I am used by almost every person. What am I?"
You know this is your first step to defusing the bomb. Answer wisely!
