You've done it! The final mechanism clicks open and the glitter bomb is defused. You feel relief wash over you. Your sibling peeks from behind the door, clearly impressed. You smile mischievously, grab a handful of glitter, and toss it at them in a joyful celebration. You've conquered your fear and celebrated all things sparkly with a laugh.

'Well, I guess you won this round!' your sibling admits, shaking glitter from their hair. You both laugh, knowing this adventure will be one to remember.
