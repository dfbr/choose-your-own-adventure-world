You did it! With your correct answer, the bomb’s lights flash green, and it lets out a cheerful ding! The glitter bomb disarms, and everyone in the park cheers for you and your friends. 

Suddenly, a playful figure appears from behind a tree. It’s your friend Sam, who laughs and says, 'I can’t believe you figured it out! I’m so proud of how you all worked together to solve the puzzles! Now the park is safe and glitter-free!' Everyone is happy, and you all celebrate your teamwork and quick thinking.
