The first puzzle appears on a small screen. 'Mix the colours to find the key!' it reads. Below, you see three primary colours: red, blue, and yellow. You remember that mixing these can create new colours. The key to the next step is hidden in the secondary colour you get when you mix red and blue. Which one should you choose to move forward?
