"Let's all be Guardians together!" you say happily. "We can share the job and help each other!"

The animals' faces light up with joy! Snowbell the rabbit hops up and down with excitement. The deer's eyes sparkle. The squirrels do happy flips on the tree branches.

"What a wonderful idea!" says Snowbell. "The forest has never had a team of Guardians before. This will be even better!"

You hold the silver amulet carefully. "But how can we all wear it?" you ask. The chain is only big enough for one.

A wise old owl flies down from a high branch. You did not see her before! She has big golden eyes and soft gray feathers. "I can help with that," she says in a deep, gentle voice.

The owl touches the amulet with her wing. Magic sparkles fill the air! The amulet begins to glow brighter and brighter. Then, something amazing happens.

The one amulet becomes many! Now there is a small silver leaf charm for each animal. There is one for you, one for Snowbell, one for the deer, and one for every animal who wants to help!

"These charms are all connected," explains the owl. "They share the same magic. When you work together, the magic is even stronger. This is the way it was always meant to be."

You put your charm on its chain around your neck. All the other animals put on their charms too. You can feel the connection between all of you. It is like a warm, happy feeling in your heart.

"As Guardian Team," says the owl, "you will each have special jobs. Luna, you will be the Leader because you found the amulet. Snowbell, you will be the Messenger because you can hop fast. Deer, you will be the Watcher because you can see far. Each animal will use their special skills to help."

From that day on, you and your friends work together to protect the forest. You meet every morning under the old oak tree. You make sure every part of the forest is safe and healthy.

When there is a problem, you work together to fix it. When a baby bird needs help, you and Snowbell find its nest. When a stream gets blocked, you and the deer clear it. When flowers need planting, you and the squirrels work as a team.

The forest becomes the most beautiful, happy place anyone has ever seen. Animals from other forests come to visit and say, "Wow! Your forest is amazing!" And you smile and say, "That's because we all work together!"

Every night, you go home with your silver charm glowing softly. You are proud to be part of the Guardian Team. You have learned that working together is the best kind of magic.
