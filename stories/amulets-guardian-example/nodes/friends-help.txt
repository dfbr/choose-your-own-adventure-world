"I see something in the tree hole!" you call down to the animals. "But I think I need help!"

All the animals gather at the bottom of the tree. They look up at you with eager, helpful faces.

"We will help you!" calls the rabbit. "Tell us what you need!"

You think for a moment. "The hole is deep. I can reach the amulet, but I might drop it when I climb down. Can someone catch it if I drop it?"

The deer steps forward. "I can help! I am tall. If you drop it carefully, I can catch it on my antlers!"

You carefully reach into the hole and take out the glowing silver amulet. Your heart beats fast with excitement and also a little bit of worry. You do not want to drop something so special!

"Ready?" you call down.

"Ready!" calls the deer.

You hold the amulet in your mouth very carefully. You start to climb down the tree. The branches are still rough and strong under your paws. You go slowly, one step at a time.

When you are halfway down, you realize it is hard to climb with the amulet in your mouth! Your teeth are getting tired.

"I need to drop it now!" you call through your teeth.

"Drop it! I am ready!" says the deer.

You drop the amulet. It falls down, down, down. The deer moves her head just right, and the amulet lands perfectly on her antlers! All the animals cheer!

You climb the rest of the way down. When you reach the ground, everyone crowds around to see the amulet. It glows with beautiful silver light.

"You did it!" says Snowbell. "But you could not have done it alone. We worked together!"

The wise owl flies down. "This is how the amulet should be protected," she says. "Not by one Guardian alone, but by friends working together. From now on, you will all share the job of keeping the forest safe."

The owl touches the amulet with her wing. Magic sparkles appear! The amulet splits into many small charms, one for each animal. Each charm glows just as brightly as the original.

You all put on your charms. You feel connected to each other and to the forest. You are not just friends now – you are a team!

From that day on, you work together to protect the forest. Each animal uses their special skills. You climb trees. The deer watches for danger. The birds fly high to see far away. The rabbit hops fast to carry messages. The squirrels gather food for anyone who is hungry.

The forest becomes the happiest, healthiest forest in the whole world. And it is all because friends worked together.

The End
