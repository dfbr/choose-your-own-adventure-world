You decide to ask the butterflies for help. They are fluttering all around the flower bed, and they seem very wise and graceful.

You sit very still and speak softly. "Excuse me, beautiful butterflies. Can you help me? I am looking for something magic."

The butterflies stop flying for a moment. They land on the flowers all around you. One big orange butterfly lands right on your nose! It tickles, but you do not move. You do not want to scare them away.

"We can help you," says the orange butterfly in a tiny, musical voice. "We see everything from up in the air. We know many secrets of the garden."

Another butterfly, this one yellow with black spots, speaks up. "We have seen something glowing in the old oak tree. It started glowing just this morning. Is that what you are looking for?"

Your ears perk up with excitement. "Yes! I think it might be! Can you show me?"

All the butterflies lift up into the air at once. They fly in a circle around your head, then start moving toward the oak tree. You follow them, walking quickly but carefully through the garden.

The butterflies fly around and around the tree. They make a beautiful pattern in the air with their colorful wings. Then they all land on one spot on the tree trunk.

You look where they are pointing with their delicate wings. There is a small hole in the tree! The butterflies flutter near it.

"Inside," whispers the orange butterfly. "The magic is inside!"

You stand up on your back legs. You reach your paw carefully into the hole. At first you feel only rough wood and darkness. Then your paw touches something smooth and cool and magical.

You pull it out slowly. Your eyes get big and round. It is a silver amulet shaped like a leaf! The amulet hangs from a delicate chain. It glows with soft, beautiful light. Magic sparkles dance around it.

"You found it!" cheer all the butterflies. They dance in the air with joy. "You found the Amulet of the Forest!"

You hold the amulet gently in your paw. It feels warm and good. The butterflies circle around you, and flower petals start falling from the sky like snow. It is the most magical moment of your whole life!

"Thank you for helping me," you say to the butterflies. "I could not have found it without you!"

The butterflies bow in the air. "You were kind to ask us for help," says the orange butterfly. "Now you must decide what to do with the amulet. It is very special and very important."

You look at the glowing amulet in your paw. You feel proud and excited and also a little bit nervous. This is a big responsibility!

What will you do?
