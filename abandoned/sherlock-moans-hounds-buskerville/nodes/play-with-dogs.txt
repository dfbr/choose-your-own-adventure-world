You decide to continue playing with the dogs. They frolic around you, making you laugh. You feel a surge of joy as you engage with them. But then, one dog darts off into the bushes, and the others follow!

You chase after them, heart pounding with excitement. They lead you to a clearing where the ground is soft and grassy. As you catch up, you notice something glimmering in the dirt.

Do you want to dig around the glimmering object, or call for help from Mr. Jenkins?
