You decide to continue searching in the park clearing. As you dig around, you find a small wooden box buried beneath the roots of a bush. It feels heavy and mysterious!

With excitement bubbling inside you, you carefully pull it out. As you open the box, you find it filled with old letters tied together with a ribbon. They look ancient and could hold secrets about the townhouse's past.

Do you want to take the box back to the townhouse, or read a letter right here in the clearing?
