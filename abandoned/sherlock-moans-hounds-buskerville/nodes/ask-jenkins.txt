You turn to Mr. Jenkins and ask about his missing cat. He explains, "She disappeared last week. At night, I can hear strange howling in the alley behind my building! I’m sure the hounds—or maybe those wild foxes—are responsible!"

You think for a moment and ask, "Have you seen the hounds or foxes?" Mr. Jenkins shakes his head. "No, but I found paw prints near the rubbish bins. They were huge!"

Feeling inquisitive, you ask Mr. Jenkins to show you the alley. He agrees, and soon you follow him past the city lights and into a narrow lane. The glow of streetlamps flickers above you.

In the alley, you notice something interesting. There are indeed large paw prints in the mud! But next to them, you spot something shiny.

Do you want to examine the shiny object, or look for more clues around the alley?
