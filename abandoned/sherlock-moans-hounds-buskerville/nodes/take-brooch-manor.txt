You decide to take the silver brooch back to the manor. Mr. Jenkins accompanies you, both buzzing with excitement. When you arrive, you head straight to the study.

Placing the brooch on the table, you ponder its significance. You remember the stories about the hounds guarding treasures. Could this brooch be a key to the legend?

As you talk with Mr. Jenkins, an idea springs to mind. Do you want to look for more connections between the brooch and the treasure, or do you think it’s time to investigate the hidden door you found earlier?
