You turn to Miss Green and ask her why she doubts the stories of the dogs. She replies, "I think it’s just a tale to scare children! There are no ghostly dogs!" You nod, but something about her words intrigues you.

"What if there is a reason for this story?" you suggest. Miss Green looks thoughtful. "I just don’t believe it!" But you feel there is more to this.

You decide to dig deeper. You remember hearing about the history of Buskerville Townhouse and its legends. "Have you heard any of the old stories about the townhouse?" you ask. Miss Green nods but seems hesitant to share.

Do you want to press her for more details, or ask Mr. Jenkins for his take on the legends?
