You decide to investigate the creek in the city park. The water is clear, and you can see small fish swimming around. As you bend down to take a closer look, you notice something shiny at the bottom!

Curious, you reach in and pull out a beautiful stone with intricate patterns. It sparkles in the sunlight.

Do you want to keep the stone, or search more around the creek?
