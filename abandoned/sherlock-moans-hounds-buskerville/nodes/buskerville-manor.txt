With determination, you head straight to Buskerville Townhouse. The grand old building stands tall among the city streets, its windows glowing in the evening light. You can feel the mysterious atmosphere, but you are not scared. You feel brave!

As you approach the townhouse, you notice muddy footprints on the pavement. They are large and seem to lead toward the nearby city park. You take a deep breath and decide to follow the footprints.

Suddenly, you hear a howl echoing between the buildings! Your heart races, but you are excited. You think, 'This is it! The city mystery unfolds!'

Do you want to follow the footprints toward the park, or explore the townhouse first?
