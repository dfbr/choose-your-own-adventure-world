You decide to turn back toward the light. As you emerge from the tunnel, you take a deep breath of fresh air. Mr. Jenkins looks relieved to see you.

"What do we do now?" he asks. You think for a moment and decide that perhaps it's time to gather more information about the treasure and the legends.

You suggest heading back into the village to ask more residents. Mr. Jenkins nods enthusiastically, and off you go!

When you reach the village, you spot a group of children playing. Do you want to join them, or ask the grown-ups for stories?
