You decide to follow the map. It leads you and Mr. Jenkins through the city park, the air alive with excitement. You soon arrive at a spot marked 'Treasure'. You start digging in the loose dirt near a cluster of bushes, your heart racing!

Suddenly, your shovel hits something hard. You dig with excitement, uncovering a small wooden chest! You and Mr. Jenkins exchange wide-eyed glances.

Do you want to open the chest right now, or wait to examine it back at the townhouse?
