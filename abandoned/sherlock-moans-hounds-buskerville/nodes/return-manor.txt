You decide to return to the townhouse with the old coin. As you enter the study, you feel a sense of accomplishment. You can’t wait to share your findings with Mr. Jenkins!

You lay the coin on the table next to the silver brooch. Both items shine under the dim light. Mr. Jenkins looks at them with wonder.

"These must be connected to the treasure!" he exclaims. You both agree to look for more connections between the items and the legends.

Do you want to search the study for more clues, or do you think it’s time to investigate the hidden door?
