You decide to approach the friendly dogs. They wag their tails and jump around you, full of energy. Their barks are happy, and you can’t help but smile! One dog nudges you with its nose, asking for attention.

As you pet the dogs, you notice they are all wearing colorful collars. One collar seems different, with a small tag. You read it and discover it has a name: 'Lucky'. Could this be a clue?

The dogs suddenly stop and look into the city park. You sense they are picking up on something. Do you want to investigate where they are looking, or continue playing with the dogs?
