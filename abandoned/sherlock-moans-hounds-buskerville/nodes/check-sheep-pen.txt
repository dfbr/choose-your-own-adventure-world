You decide to check the alleyway again. As you arrive, you see the sun starting to set, painting the sky in hues of pink and orange. The stray cats are gathered together, looking skittish.

You spot something shiny near a rubbish bin. Curiously, you approach and discover it is a silver whistle! You wonder if it belongs to someone.

Suddenly, you hear a bark! One of the dogs you saw earlier runs up to you, tail wagging. You realize this is a key clue! Do you want to take the whistle and follow the dog, or examine the cats for more signs?
