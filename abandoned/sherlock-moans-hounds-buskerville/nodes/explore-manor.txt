You decide to explore the townhouse first. As you enter, the air feels heavy with mystery. Dust motes swirl in the sunlight that streams through the tall windows. You can hear the creaking of the old floorboards beneath your feet.

In the corner of the main hallway, you spot a large portrait of a man who looks like he could be the owner of the townhouse. His eyes seem to follow you!

You walk closer and notice something shiny on the floor beneath the portrait. It looks like an old key!

Do you want to take the key, or keep searching the townhouse for more clues?
