You proudly say, "Neil Armstrong!" The stink bomb beeps green and gives a happy buzz! Your friends cheer and celebrate! The park ranger claps and says, "You did it! You solved every challenge and defused the stink bomb!" Everyone in the park starts to cheer for you and your friends!

Just then, a familiar face steps out from behind a tree. It’s your friend Max! He giggles and says, "I’m so proud of you all! I set up the stink bomb to see if you could solve the puzzles. You worked great as a team!" Everyone laughs together. You feel proud and happy knowing that you saved the day!

As you all celebrate, the sun shines brighter and laughter fills the air. You learned a lot, had fun, and made memories with your friends. This was a day to remember!

The End.
