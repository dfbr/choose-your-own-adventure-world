Main Story Beats:
- The story revolves around planning a child's birthday party. Each choice leads to more fun and exciting activity in the party.
- There should be a choice over the theme of the party (e.g. surprise, outdoor, card game party, trampolining etc)
- There should be a choice of who to invite
- There should be a choice of whether or not it's a surprise party or known to the person whose birthday it is.
- Choose what food to have and how to decorate the table and house.
- Choose what the birthday cake should look like and what flavour it should be.
- Choose where to hold the party e.g. at home, in the park, or at a trampoline park.
- What music and activities will there be at the party?
- Multiple endings: The story should end with guests arriving and enjoying the party just as it has been planned, thanking the host and receiving exciting goody bags as they go home.

Tone: mysterious (for the person it's a party for), humorous, spooky, educational, fun
