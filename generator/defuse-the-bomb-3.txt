- They work together to solve 15 challenges to defuse the bomb.
- There are maths problems, substitution cyphers, riddles, logic problems, facts on science, animals, nature, space etc.
- At each puzzle, they must get the right answer to progress with defusing the bomb.
- If they get an answer wrong, the stink bomb goes off. Each ending in this way should be unique and fun with no one getting harmed and should reveal what the correct answer is.
- Come up with at least 12 different puzzles for the story reader to answer and associated narrative text to go with the puzzles.
- Upon defusing the bomb, the culprit should reveal themselves and say how proud they are of the team working together to solve the problems and defuse the bomb.
