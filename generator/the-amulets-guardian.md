Generate a Choose Your Own Adventure story with the following outline:

Title: The amulet's guardian

Setting: A deep underwater cavern that contains mysteries like locked chests, wall carvings and hidden doors etc.

Protagonist: The reader (main protagonist) is a mermaid with special powers. They are not royalty but come from the common mermaid lineage.

Main Story Beats:
- At the start the ocean is falling apart because the amulet has been lost.
- The story becomes a quest to find the amulet.
- When they go through one of the doors in the story it will slam shut behind them.
- There will be a mysterious guardian protecting an amulet that protects the life force of the ocean.
- There should be wall carvings about how the amulet was made and then how it came to be hidden in the cave.
- There should be a choice to go into different tunnels that have different personalities/features (e.g. warm/cold water or dark/light tunnels etc)
- Multiple endings: finding the amulet and restoring peace, not finding the amulet, find a potion and escape to the land leaving the ocean behind without the amulet, finding that the amulet isn't needed but instead the sea creatures need to unite.

Tone: Adventurous filled with mystery and danger. Not too dark, suitable for all ages.

Branching Structure: Create at least 3 distinct paths that lead to different endings, with some paths that reconnect to create interesting narrative loops.
