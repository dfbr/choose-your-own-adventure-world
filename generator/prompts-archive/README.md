# Story Prompts Archive

This directory is for storing your used story prompts for reference and reuse.

## Safety Features

✅ **Not Published to GitHub Pages** - The entire `generator/` directory is excluded in `_config.yml`  
✅ **Tracked in Git** - Story prompts are committed to your repository for backup and version control  
✅ **Private Repository** - Only visible if your repository is private

## How to Use

After generating a story, move or copy your user prompt file here:

```bash
# After generating a story
mv my-story-prompt.txt prompts-archive/my-story-prompt.txt

# Or copy to keep the original
cp my-story-prompt.txt prompts-archive/my-story-prompt-2025-11-10.txt
```

## Organization Tips

Consider organizing your prompts by:
- **Date**: `prompts-archive/2025-11-10-magic-garden.txt`
- **Category**: `prompts-archive/puzzle/defuse-bomb.txt`
- **Series**: `prompts-archive/series/dragon-adventures-01.txt`

## Reusing Prompts

You can reuse prompts to:
- Generate variations of a story
- Update a story with different character details
- Create a series with consistent style but different plots
- Experiment with different image styles

Simply copy a prompt from here back to the main generator directory and modify as needed.
