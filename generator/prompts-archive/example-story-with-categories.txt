Title: The Secret Garden Portal

Categories: magic, adventure, nature, friendship

Setting: A modern-day neighborhood with an overgrown community garden that hides a magical portal to a nature realm where plants and animals can talk. The garden is threatened by developers.

Protagonist: You are an 8-year-old child who loves plants and has just moved to a new neighborhood. You're shy but curious, and you discover the garden while exploring.

Main Story Beats:
- Discover the hidden garden and meet a talking squirrel
- Learn about the portal and the magical nature realm
- Find out developers want to tear down the garden
- Gather magical seeds to save the garden
- Rally neighborhood friends to help
- Multiple endings: Successfully save the garden and keep the portal secret, save the garden but the magic fades, or the garden is saved but becomes too popular and the magic is discovered

Tone: Warm, gentle, and hopeful with themes of environmental stewardship and community action. Age-appropriate for early readers (ages 5-8, K-2 reading level). Empowering message about kids making a difference.

Branching Structure: 3-4 main paths with some convergence points. Include moments where choosing to be brave vs. cautious leads to different helpers. Some paths focus on magical solutions, others on practical community organizing.

Special Requirements: Use simple plant and animal vocabulary. Include gentle lessons about ecosystems and working together. Keep all magical elements light and fun, not scary.
